----------------------------------------------------

To the patron, being blocked will look like this:

Unlocking an account

2. Enter the new password for the patron on the "Change password" page.  Please note that you cannot recover an old password.  All you can do is create a new one.

3. After saving the new password, the message will no longer display on the patron's account.

Note: You cannot unlock a patron's account through the "Edit" patron function.  It will update the patron's password, but it will not unlock the patron's account.  You *must* use the "Change password" function to unlock the account.

Unlock through the OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a patron locks their account *and* there is an e-mail address on their account, they can unlock the account themselves through the "Forgot your password" feature in the OPAC.

1. On the OPAC login page, the patron should click on the "Forgot your password?" link.

2. On the "Forgot your password?" page, the patron needs to fill out the form with A) their card number or username; and B) the e-mail address that goes with this account.

3. If the login information and the e-mail address match this message should appear:

4. If successful, the patron should receive an e-mail address like this one within 15 minutes:

5. When the patron opens the link included in the e-mail, they should taken to a page that will allow them to create a new password:
