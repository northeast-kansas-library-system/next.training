Next Search Catalog history
###########################

Next Search Catalog began as a courier system among Northeast Kansas libraries, and several Northeast Kansas Library System members participated with the Kansas City Public Library Consortia (KCLC) through 2008.  In 2007, NEKLS began to explore alternative options to KCLC, and NEKLS decided in 2008 to manage its own shared catalog called "NExpress."  The Koha integrated library management system was chosen and NEKLS contracted with LibLime - a division of Progressive Technology Federal Systems, Inc. (PTFS).  The Next Koha system went live on August 15, 2008, with 13 participating libraries. In 2011, NEKLS changed support companies from LibLime to ByWater Solutions.  In August of 2018 the catalog was re-branded from NExpress to "Next Search Catalog" and, as of January 2019, includes 44 public libraries; 1 school district; and 1 community college library.
