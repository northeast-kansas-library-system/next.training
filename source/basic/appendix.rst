.. _checkinaccess:

Three ways to access check-in
-----------------------------


A. Access check-in from the flexible input box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From most pages you can set the flexible input box to Check in and then start entering barcode numbers in the input box.

B. Access check-in from the home page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


From the home page you can click on the "Circulation" button and then click on the "Check in" button on the circulation page.

C. Access check in from any page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From any page you can click on the "Circulation" link in the page header and then click on the "Check in" button on the circulation page.

.. _stafflocked:

Staff account locked due to unsuccessful login attempts
-------------------------------------------------------

If you attempt to log into the staff client more than five (5) times with an incorrect password, the account you're using will be locked.  This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing the confidential information on our system.

If this happens, you have two (2) options for unlocking the account:

Unlock by calling NEKLS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because staff login accounts have a "SYSTEM LOGIN ONLY" account category, only system administrators can change the passwords on these accounts through the staff client.  Since the only system administrators are at the NEKLS office, if you lock yourself out, NEKLS staff should be able to give you a new password to unlock the account.

Unlock through the OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you lock a staff account *and* there is an e-mail address on the account, you can unlock the account yourself by clicking on the "You must reset your password" text on the login page.

Note: most staff accounts such as LIBRARYCIRC; LIBRARYTECH; and LIBRARYDIRECTOR have the default e-mail address for that library on the account as their e-mail address.  If you do not normally have access to this account or are unsure which email account goes with your account, this method will not really work for you.

1. On the staff client login page, click on the "You must reset your password" link.

2. On the "Forgot your password?" page, you need to fill out the form with A) your staff username; and B) the e-mail address that goes with this account.

3. If the login information and the e-mail address match this message should appear:

4. If successful, you should receive an e-mail address like this one within 15 minutes:

5. When you open the link included in the e-mail, you should be taken to a page that will allow you to create a new password:

6. A final message should indicate if the password has been successfully changed.

7. Go back to the login page and try to log in again with the new password.
